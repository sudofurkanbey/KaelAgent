# KaelAgent

🚀 **GPT-4 Powered Terminal Agent – For Flutter Developers**

KaelAgent is an autonomous CLI-based agent designed to analyze and optionally fix build/runtime issues in Flutter projects. Built on GPT-4, it empowers developers with smart debugging capabilities directly in the terminal.

## 🧠 Features

- Identifies build and runtime errors in Flutter projects  
- Suggests or automatically applies fixes *(fail-safe mode supported)*  
- Goes beyond reporting – capable of taking action  
- Lightweight and terminal-friendly execution  
- Targets only the necessary parts of the code without breaking structure  

## 🔧 Current Usage (Experimental Phase)

> This project is under **active development** and currently intended for **personal use only**. Core modules are not fully released yet.

- Run `kael_agent.py` (or `main.py`) to initiate CLI control  
- Once the target project directory is set, it analyzes `flutter pub get`, `flutter run`, and `flutter doctor` outputs  
- Errors are parsed and suggestions/fixes are offered interactively  

## 📦 Installation (coming soon)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sudofurkanbey/KaelAgent.git  
cd KaelAgent  
python kael_agent.py
```

## 🔐 Environment Setup

This project uses a `.env` file to store sensitive information like your OpenAI API key.

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.10+  
- Flutter SDK (configured in environment)  
- OpenAI API Key (for GPT-4 access)  
- Unix-based system recommended (Linux/macOS)

## 🗺 Roadmap

- [x] Basic terminal output parsing  
- [ ] Modular error classifier  
- [ ] Interactive fix suggestion UI (CLI prompts)  
- [ ] Fail-safe execution mode (no changes unless confirmed)  
- [ ] Self-improvement loop (learning from past errors)  
- [ ] GitHub Actions integration  
- [ ] Community support & plugin ecosystem  

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

- Run the agent **in isolated environments first**. It is not production-tested.  
- This tool is experimental. Errors may occur.  
- Contribution and feedback will open once the first stable release is live.

## ✍️ Contribution & License

> Currently **private**. License and contribution guidelines will be added in future releases.

🧬 **Code. Break. Fix. Learn. – KaelAgent is always by your side.**
